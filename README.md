# Intro-to-AI
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of two machine learning exercises:

1)Linear Regression: Predicting California housing prices.
2)Support Vector Machines (SVM): Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

### Dataset Requirement
The UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset need to download manaully from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
After downloading ,extract the file and put the folder in the same project directory(folder) as the Jupyter Notebook

### How to Execute the Code:
1)Ensure the UCI HAR dataset is downloaded and placed in the project folder.
2)Open coursework.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3)Run the code
